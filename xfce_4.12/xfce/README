I like to have a GTK2-only desktop, so here it is.

Ports that are part of CRUX, but need to be locked at an older version, because of Xfce 4.12 are:

upower (0.99.13): the latest version with which xfce4-power-manager battery status works
xorg-libx11 (1.8): Xfce 4.12 themes settings do not get applied with version >1.8

Make sure you install the locked ports first, then you can build the whole desktop with:

	prt-get depinst xfce

Check /usr/etc/xdg/xfce4, there are examples for .bashrc_profile, .bashrc and Xfce's .xinitrc
