I like to have a GTK2-only desktop, so here it is.

Ports that are part of CRUX, but need to be locked at an older version,
because of Xfce 4.12 are:

upower (0.99.13): for xfce4-power-manager battery status
xorg-libx11 (1.8): Xfce 4.12 themes settings to be applied
libblockdev (2.28): for udisks2 proper work

Make sure you have these installed and locked first; or you place in 
/etc/prt-get.conf the following line before contrib, core, opt, xorg:

	prtdir /usr/ports/xfce_4.12

Then you can build the whole desktop with:

	prt-get depinst xfce

This installs example .xinitrc and .xprofile, as well as basic .config
in /etc/skel. If you are not making a new user, just copy these to ~/.
