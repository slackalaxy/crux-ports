Do not install hpcups. Check this link for more info:

I have LaserJet P1005. In my particular case, I did the following:

	modprobe usblp
	sleep 3
	cat /usr/share/foo2xqx/firmware/sihpP1005.dl > /dev/usb/lp0
	sleep 3
	rmmod usblp
	/etc/rc.d/cups restart

Despite what cups README says, you may wish to keep the `usblp` module
loaded at boot time, by adding it to:

	/etc/rc.modules

In this case, make sure it is NOT blacklisted in:

	/etc/modprobe.d/cups.conf
