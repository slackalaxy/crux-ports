GRUB, in UEFI boot mode. Install grub2 into the EFI system partition:
  
  grub-install /boot/efi 

Replace /boot/efi with the location of the mounted ESP. If efibootmgr
was selected during the package selection phase, grub-install will
automatically create a boot entry and make it active. Run:

  grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

GRUB, in legacy (non-UEFI) boot mode. Install grub2 into the MBR, by:

  grub-install /dev/sd??

Replace /dev/sd?? with the actual node of the device whose MBR you want
to overwrite, eg., /dev/sda for the first SATA disk. Run:

  grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

grub-mkconfig's output can be altered by setting variables in:

  /etc/default/grub

Note about GRUB_FONT:
pf2 fonts can be created using the grub2-mkfont utility. For example,
to create a GRUB2 fp2 font from a TTF (True Text Font) run:

  mkdir -p /boot/grub/fonts
  grub-mkfont /usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/VeraMono.ttf --size=16 --output /boot/grub/fonts/VeraMono.pcf

To use the newly created font, point to it, as:

  GRUB_FONT="/boot/grub/fonts/VeraMono.pcf"
