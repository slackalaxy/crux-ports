You probably do not need all languages, listed in "DICTIONARIES".

So, you can just edit the "DICTIONARIES" list file, distributed with the
Pkgfile, and leave the ones you want. Note, that this will change the
.footprint of the produced package. Also, I can't test all these, so if
there are issues with a language you speak, let me know.
