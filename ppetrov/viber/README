Make sure gtk3 was compiled against wayland, otherwise file save dialogs
will make the program crash!

Viber may not run if you have an "exotic" keyboard layout. Check this

In my case, I have Finnish and Bulgarian (phonetic) layouts, so to make
Viber start, I needed to first execute this:

	setxkbmap -variant ' ,phonetic'

Note the space in ' ,phonetic'. I use Xfce, so I put the above command
among the start up applications.
