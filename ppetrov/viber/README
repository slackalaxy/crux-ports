Viber will not run if you have an "exotic" keyboard layout. Check this

In my case, I have Finnish and Bulgarian (phonetic) layouts, so to make
Viber start, I needed to first execute this:

	setxkbmap -variant ' ,phonetic'

Note the space in ' ,phonetic'. I use Xfce, so I put the above command
among the start up applications.
