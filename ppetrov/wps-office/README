Troubleshooting
WPS Office Overriding/Breaks Mime
* Close all WPS Office programs
* Open ~/.config/Kingsoft/Office.conf
* Add the following, just before [kdcsdk]:

  common\do_not_detect_file_association_while_startup=true

* Save the file
* You may need to also clean WPS Office associated stuff from (or just
  delete everything there):

  ~/.local/share/mime/
