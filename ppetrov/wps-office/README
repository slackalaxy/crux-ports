NOTE
This is the Chinese version. I switched to it, because it is usually
ahead of the English one. If the download does not work, get the deb
from the web-page:

TROUBLESHOOTING: WPS Office Overrides/Breaks Mime
* Close all WPS Office programs
* Open ~/.config/Kingsoft/Office.conf
* Add the following, just before [kdcsdk]:

    common\do_not_detect_file_association_while_startup=true

* Save the file
* You may need to also clean WPS Office associated stuff from:

    ~/.local/share/mime/

Thanks to Arch Linux for this! Check link for details:
