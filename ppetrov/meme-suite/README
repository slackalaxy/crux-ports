At compile time, meme-suite checks if its database folder folder exists:

	/var/lib/meme-suite

If you have installed any of the meme-db-* packages, this folder will be
present. If you, however, want to install meme-suite first and later set
the databases you need, just make sure that the folder is present before
building meme-suite:

	mkdir -p /var/lib/meme-suite

If you want to install the databases manually, they can be downloaded
from here:

	http://meme-suite.org/doc/download.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a good practice to run the series of tests provided by the MEME
Suite developers once the executables are built. Unfortunatelly, they
cannot be run properly as root (at least here).

You can, however, run them once the package is built, as a normal user.
Just copy the folder where the meme suite was built (pkgmk -kw) as your
normal user, navigate there and run:

	make test

You should receive a summary, like this:

========================================================================
Testsuite summary for meme 5.1.0
========================================================================
# TOTAL: 152
# PASS:  152
# SKIP:  0
# XFAIL: 0
# FAIL:  0
