With today's wide monitors, changing the resolution of the game is very
important. The ioquake3 engine provides a fix for this. Start the game
and bring down the game console by pressing the tilde (~) symbol. 

Now set the resolution (e.g. FHD) by typing:

	/r_mode -1
	/r_customheight 1080
	/r_customwidth 1920
	/vid_restart
