With the final updates of poppler and popplet-glib (22.03.0), inkscape-
gtk2 does not build anymore. Honestly, I am tired of it breaking upon
every poppler update, so I have prepared two compatibility ports:

custom/poppler21
custom/poppler21-glib

They can be installed along thir current versions, howevver poppler and
poppler-glib should not be present at build time.
