Troubleshooting
WPS Office Overriding/Breaks Mime
To Fix this problem you need to edit Office.conf in your home directory /home/<youruser>/.config/Kingsoft/Office.conf

# cd /home/<youruser>/.config/Kingsoft
or
# cd ~/.config/Kingsoft
Note: The second command for the sake of convenience


After that find Office.conf and open it using your text editor Then add the following before [kdcsdk]:

common\do_not_detect_file_association_while_startup=true

Then save it, and restart WPS Office.
