After install, create a folder in your $HOME for example "CompNet", then
navigate there and create these two symlinks:

ln -s /usr/bin/neighbor .
ln -s /usr/bin/njplot njplot.linux

Now specify the work dir of the program. Copy its desktop file from:

/usr/share/applications/compnet.desktop

to

~/.local/share/applications

Now edit the "Path=" variable in your local compnet.desktop file to
point to the work dir, using the full path, such as:

Path=/home/myuser/ComPnet

The program will otherwise write its temporary files in your $HOME.
