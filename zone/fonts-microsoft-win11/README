This uses `httpdirfs` to mount over http the Windows 11 Enterprise
90-day evaluation edition iso, downloadable from here:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-11-enterprise

The Pkgfile mounts the iso using `loop`, so you should have the module
loaded:

	modprobe loop

Upon completion the Pkgfile unmounts the iso, so make sure you do not
have the mount dir used by some other program (e.g. opened terminal).
