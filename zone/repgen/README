When generating the packages repository, install-scripts are collected
by pkg-repgen into a single file called PKGINST. They are stored as
individual functions and, upon a package install, its corresponding
function is called by the if statement in the end of the file:

389 if [ ! -z "$1" ]; then $1; fi

Here I encountered a problem, because pkg-get was not able to find the
functions for packages containing a dash in their name. It seems dashes
become transformed into underscores: for example, the function for
adwaita-icon-theme is named like this:

adwaita_icon_theme_post_install() {
...
}

I am not sure if this is a bug, or I simply did not configure something
properly. For now, I modified the last line, to make it substitute all
dashes with underscores:

389 if [ ! -z "$1" ]; then ${1//-/_}; fi

Depending on how your packages are compressed (tar.gz or tar.xz), use
the modified pkg-repgen, as:

	pkg-repgen-gz
	pkg-repgen-xz
