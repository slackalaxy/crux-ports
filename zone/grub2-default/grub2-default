# Default menu entry selected on boot. The entry may be identified by
# number (starting from 0), title, or id. When using submenus, it is
# specified by menu>submenu, like 0>1, or other>minix>minix-3.4.0.
#GRUB_DEFAULT=0

# Delay (in seconds) before booting default menu entry. Set to 0 to boot
# immediately or -1 to wait indefinitely.
#GRUB_TIMEOUT=12

# Device node for the volume containing the root filesystem. Set this to
# override the grub2-mkconfig command's root device auto-detection. For
# example, GRUB_DEVICE=/dev/ram0 will force root=/dev/ram0 to be used
# in the kernel command line. (detected)
#GRUB_DEVICE=

# UUID of the root filesystem. (detected)
#GRUB_DEVICE_UUID=

# If true, recovery menu entries will not be generated. On Linux,
# recovery entries pass "single" on the kernel command-line. (false)
#GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=false

# Use a custom font (converted using grub-mkfont) on the graphical
# terminal. Font should be in pf2 format to be used during gfxmode
# display. See the port's README for more info. 
#GRUB_FONT=/usr/share/grub/unicode.pf2

# When true, the os-prober utility is bypassed meaning additional OS
# loaders will not be searched. Setting GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
# will have grub-mkconfig search for additional installations when
# os-prober is installed.
#GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true

# List of GRUB module names separated by spaces that will be loaded at
# the start of grub.cfg. This may be needed if the GRUB boot is in a LVM
# partition.
#GRUB_PRELOAD_MODULES=""

# Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for all Linux menu
# entries. For instance, to support hibernation, users will need to add
# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="resume=/dev/sdXY" with /dev/sdXY being the swap
# partition:
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""

# Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for non-recovery
# Linux menu entries:
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""

# If true, ${GRUB_DEVICE} is passed in the root parameter on the kernel
# command line. If false, ${GRUB_DEVICE_UUID} is passed in the root
# parameter on the kernel command line when an initramfs is available.
# (false)
#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true

# If set to false, and if there is either no initramfs, or GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true,
# ${GRUB_DEVICE_PARTUUID} is passed in the root parameter on the kernel
# command line. (true)
#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID=true

# Controls the video mode in which the Linux kernel starts. May be set
# to "text", "keep", or a display resolution. Set to "keep", in order to
# keep the resolution when loading the kernel. (text)
#GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text

# Set resolution and color depth
# Note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via
# VBE you can see them in real GRUB with the command 'vbeinfo':
#GRUB_GFXMODE=

# Set a background image
#GRUB_BACKGROUND=

# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
#GRUB_TERMINAL=console

# If this option is set to true, flat menu with all entries on top level
# will be generated. (false)
#GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true

# Set by distributors of GRUB to their identifying name. This is used to
# generate more informative menu entry titles.
#GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="CRUX"
