This packages the Linux kernel distributed with CRUX 3.8. The build
uses the user-contributed modular config file and downloads the source from
kernel.org.

The port adds "-m" as local version, including the source folder.

Inspect the config if you want to make any modifications and if your
filesystem is supported. Ata a glance, these are built into the kernel:

	EXT4
	XFS
	BTRFS

It is up to you to create a symlink for System.map:

	/boot/System.map -> /boot/System.map-6.12.23-m

Same goes for the krenel itself (disputed if needed):
	
	/usr/src/linux-6.12.23-m/ -> /usr/src/linux
