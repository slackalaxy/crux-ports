This packages a Linux kernel/modules for CRUX 3.8. The build uses a
slightly modified config file from Slackware, namely:

Library routines --->
  [ ]   Select compiled-in fonts

Device Drivers --->
  Graphics support --->
    [ ]   Bootup logo ----

Source is downloaded from https://kernel.org/

Nothe that only the kernel and modules are shipped, the sources are left
out. "-m" is used as local version for kernel and modules.

Inspect the config if you want to make any modifications and to check if
your filesystem is supported. At a glance, these are built in:

File systems --->
  <*> The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem
  [*]   Use ext4 for ext2 file systems
  [*]   Ext4 Security Labels

  <*> XFS filesystem support
  [*]   Support deprecated V4 (crc=0) format
  [*]   Support deprecated case-insensitive ascii (ascii-ci=1) format
  [*]   XFS Quota support
  [*]   XFS POSIX ACL support 
  
It is up to you to create this symlink for System.map:

	/boot/System.map -> /boot/System.map-6.12.25-m

Same goes for the kernel itself (disputed if needed):
	
	/usr/src/linux-6.12.25-m/ -> /usr/src/linux


Don't forget to update Grub config, e.g.:

GRUB, in UEFI boot mode. Install grub2 into the EFI system partition:
  
  grub-install /boot/efi 

Replace /boot/efi with the location of the mounted ESP. If efibootmgr
was selected during the package selection phase, grub-install will
automatically create a boot entry and make it active.

GRUB, in legacy (non-UEFI) boot mode. Install grub2 into the MBR, by:

  grub-install /dev/sd??

Replace /dev/sd?? with the actual node of the device whose MBR you want
to overwrite, e.g. /dev/sda, for the first SATA disk. 

In either case, run afterwards:

  grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

The grub-mkconfig's output can be altered by setting variables in 
(installed by the grub2-default port):

  /etc/default/grub
