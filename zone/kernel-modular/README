This packages a Linux kernel/modules for CRUX 3.8. The build uses a
slightly modified config file from Slackware and downloads the source
from https://kernel.org/

Nothe that only the kernel and modules are shipped, the sources are left
out. "-m" is used as local version for kernel and modules.

Inspect the config if you want to make any modifications and if your
filesystem is supported. At a glance, these are built into the kernel:

	EXT4
	XFS
	BTRFS

It is up to you to create a symlink for System.map:

	/boot/System.map -> /boot/System.map-6.12.25-m

Same goes for the krenel itself (disputed if needed):
	
	/usr/src/linux-6.12.25-m/ -> /usr/src/linux



Don't forget to update Grub config, e.g.:

GRUB, in UEFI boot mode. Install grub2 into the EFI system partition:
  
  grub-install /boot/efi 

Replace /boot/efi with the location of the mounted ESP. If efibootmgr
was selected during the package selection phase, grub-install will
automatically create a boot entry and make it active. Run:

  grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

GRUB, in legacy (non-UEFI) boot mode. Install grub2 into the MBR, by:

  grub-install /dev/sd??

Replace /dev/sd?? with the actual node of the device whose MBR you want
to overwrite, eg., /dev/sda for the first SATA disk. Run:

  grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

grub-mkconfig's output can be altered by setting variables in:

  /etc/default/grub
