This packages the Linux kernel distributed with CRUX 3.7. The build
uses the user-contributed modular config file, available from here:

http://ftp.spline.inf.fu-berlin.de/pub/crux/loop/crux/kernel/contrib/

The port adds "-m" as local version, including the source folder.

Inspect the config if you want to make any modifications and if your
filesystem is supported. Ata a glance, these are built into the kernel:

	EXT4
	XFS
	BTRFS

It is up to you to create a symlink for System.map:

	/boot/System.map -> /boot/System.map-5.15.55-m

Same goes for the krenel itself (disputed if needed):
	
	/usr/src/linux-5.15.55-m/ -> /usr/src/linux
