# Ports for CRUX 3.8

This is my personal collection of CRUX ports. Many of them were written
by me, others were adapted from existing ports. There are also some that
were shamelessly stolen and put here, so I have a single place for all.
It just makes it more simple to have a unified place of "cherry picked"
ports, than a bunch of repos with overlapping entries.

It would be too complicated to track back the original authors, in order
to credit them properly. So, if someone recognised their port and wants
to be credited, let me know!

### ppetrov/
Main collection of programs and libraries. Most likely this is what you
are interested in.
* [ppetrov.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/ppetrov/ppetrov.httpup)
* [ppetrov.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/ppetrov/ppetrov.pub)

There are 4 ports with unversioned sources, that simply use the latest
tarball provided by upstream: google-chrome, mplayer, viber and zoom-linux,
therefore `.signature` and `.footprint` may mismatch.

### r4-modules/
R modules, mostly generated by my own tool called 
[cran2crux](https://github.com/slackalaxy/cran2crux) (included in the repo).
* [r4-modules.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/r4-modules/r4-modules.httpup)
* [r4-modules.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/r4-modules/r4-modules.pub)

Have the **ppetrov** repo enabled, to satisfy dependencies of some ports.

### p5-modules/
Perl modules, initially generated by the amazing
[cpan2crux](https://www.mizrahi.com.ve/crux/ports/cpan2crux/Pkgfile). **This repo is not at portdb.**
* [p5-modules.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/p5-modules/r4-modules.httpup)
* [p5-modules.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/p5-modules/p5-modules.pub)

### zone/
Ports that package custom settings files, configs, modified programs,
my own scripts, workarounds, as well as more unconventional stuff all go in the zone. **This repo is not at portdb.**
* [zone.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/zone/zone.httpup)
* [zone.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/zone/zone.pub)
