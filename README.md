# Ports for CRUX 3.7

This is my personal collection of CRUX ports. Many of them were written
by me, others were adapted from existing ports. There are also some that
were shamelessly stolen and put here, so I have a single place for all.
It just makes it more simple to have a unified place of "cherry picked"
ports, than a bunch of repos with overlapping entries.

It would be too complicated to track back the original authors, in order
to credit them properly. So, if someone recognised their port and wants
to be credited, let me know!

## ppetrov/
Main collection of programs and libraries. Most likely this is what you
are interested in.
* [ppetrov.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/ppetrov/ppetrov.httpup)
* [ppetrov.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/ppetrov/ppetrov.pub)

There are 4 unversioned ports, that simply use the latest tarball
provided by upstream:
* google-chrome
* mplayer
* viber
* zoom-linux

Therefore `.signature` and `.footprint` may mismatch. I can extract the
version number from the archive, but it's simpler to do it that way.

The repo contains over 60 p5 ports, initially generated by the amazing
[cpan2crux](https://www.mizrahi.com.ve/crux/ports/cpan2crux/Pkgfile).

## r4-modules/
R modules, mostly generated by my own, home-brewed tool called 
[cran2crux](https://github.com/slackalaxy/cran2crux).
* [r4-modules.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/r4-modules/r4-modules.httpup)
* [r4-modules.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/r4-modules/r4-modules.pub)

## xfce_4.12/
I like to have a GTK2-only desktop, so here it is.
* [xfce_4.12.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/xfce_4.12/xfce_4.12.httpup)
* [xfce_4.12.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/xfce_4.12/xfce_4.12.pub)

Ports that are part of CRUX, but need to be locked at an older version,
because of Xfce 4.12 are:

* upower (0.99.13): for xfce4-power-manager battery status
* xorg-libx11 (1.8): Xfce 4.12 themes settings to be applied
* libblockdev (2.28): for udisks2 proper work

Make sure you have these installed and locked first; or you place in 
`/etc/prt-get.conf` the following line *before* `contrib`, `core`, 
`opt` and `xorg`:

	prtdir /usr/ports/xfce_4.12

Then you can build the whole desktop with this dummy port (it requires
some stuff from **ppetrov**, such as icon and cursor themes):

	prt-get depinst xfce

This installs a `.xinitrc` and `.xprofile`, as well as basic `.config`
folder in `/etc/skel`, so the desktop starts with some predefined
customizations. If you are not making a new user, just copy these to
`~/`.

## zone/
Ports that package custom settings files, configs, modified programs,
scripts, workarounds (e.g. jdk symlink), as well as more unconventional
stuff all go in the zone.
