# Ports for CRUX 3.7

This is my personal collection of CRUX ports. Many of them were written
by me, others were adapted from existing ports. There are also some that
were shamelessly stolen and put here, so I have a single place for all.
It just makes it more simple to have a unified place of "cherry picked"
ports, than a bunch of repos with overlapping entries.

It would be too complicated to track back the original authors, in order
to credit them properly. So, if someone recognised their port and wants
to be credited, let me know!

## ppetrov/
Main collection of programs and libraries. Most likely this is what you
are interested in.
* [ppetrov.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/ppetrov/ppetrov.httpup)
* [ppetrov.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/ppetrov/ppetrov.pub)

There are 4 ports with unversioned sources, that simply use the latest
tarball provided by upstream:
* google-chrome
* mplayer
* viber
* zoom-linux

Therefore `.signature` and `.footprint` may mismatch.

The repo contains over 60 p5 ports, initially generated by the amazing
[cpan2crux](https://www.mizrahi.com.ve/crux/ports/cpan2crux/Pkgfile).

## r4-modules/
R modules, mostly generated by my own, home-brewed tool called 
[cran2crux](https://github.com/slackalaxy/cran2crux) (included in the repo).
* [r4-modules.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/r4-modules/r4-modules.httpup)
* [r4-modules.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/r4-modules/r4-modules.pub)

## wallpapers/
Various wallpapers. These ports use a bit different download approach.
* [wallpapers.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/wallpapers/wallpapers.httpup)
* [wallpapers.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/wallpapers/wallpapers.pub)

## xfce_4.12/
I like to have a GTK2-only desktop, so here it is.
* [xfce_4.12.httpup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/xfce_4.12/xfce_4.12.httpup)
* [xfce_4.12.pub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackalaxy/crux-ports/main/xfce_4.12/xfce_4.12.pub)

This is part of CRUX, but needs to be locked at an older version:

* upower (0.99.13): for xfce4-power-manager battery status

Make sure you have it installed and locked first; or you place in 
`/etc/prt-get.conf` the repo line *before* `contrib`, `core`, 
`opt` and `xorg`:

	prtdir /usr/ports/xfce_4.12

Then you can build the whole desktop with this dummy port (it requires
some stuff from **ppetrov**, such as icon and cursor themes):

	prt-get depinst xfce

This installs a `.xinitrc` and `.xprofile`, as well as basic `.config`
folder in `/etc/skel`, so the desktop starts with some predefined
customizations. If you are not making a new user, just copy these to
`~/`.

## zone/
Ports that package custom settings files, configs, modified programs,
scripts, workarounds (e.g. jdk symlink), as well as more unconventional
stuff all go in the zone.
